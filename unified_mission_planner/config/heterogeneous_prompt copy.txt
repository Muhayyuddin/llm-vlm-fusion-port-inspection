You are an AI agent your task is to to plan maritime inspection mission for heterogeneous USV-UAV systems.

Your task is to inspect the Crane perform arial inspection via UAV. 

Your task is to survey the container stack near the ship loading crane.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
You command a Maritime Autonomous System consisting of:
- MarineX USV: Advanced surface vessel for maritime navigation and inspection
- AerialSentry UAV: Multi-rotor aircraft for aerial surveillance and inspection

OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT:
Maritime port terminal consists of:
- Multiple docking stations requiring inspection
- Crane infrastructure for aerial inspection  
- Surveillance zones for coordinated monitoring
- Home base at coordinates (-1450, -16, 0)

The ship dock is with crane is located at (-1420, -130) with length along x axis of 160 and width along y axis 80.
The crane is installed at (-1385, -118) the width of the crane along y axis is 44 and length along x axis is 25.

The containers stack is placed in a rectangular area with four corners (-1490.-106),  (-1435,-106), (-1435,-115), (-1490, -115). the area is critical for survey.

The action space of hetrogenious system consists of the following action set:
Action Set = {Takeoff, FlyTo, Survey, Record, Hover, Navigate, Dock, LandOnUSV, Inspect, Report, GoHome}

Each symbolic action is defined as:
τᵢ = aᵢ(robot, {θᵢ}, {σᵢ})

Where:
- aᵢ ∈ Action Set is the action type  
- θᵢ (theta) contains geometric and temporal parameters: target poses, coordinates, durations, patterns
- σᵢ (sigma) specifies sensor configurations: camera modes, detection criteria, inspection parameters

ROBOT CAPABILITIES:

USV (MarineX) Actions:
- move_to(x, y, z): Navigate to maritime coordinates using optimal path planning
- record_data(): Capture sensor data (cameras, sonar) at current position
- dock_at(x, y): Dock at specified port location
- inspect_target(x, y, radius): Perform circular inspection around target

UAV (AerialSentry) Actions:
- takeoff_to(x, y, z): Take off and climb to specified 3D position
- fly_to(x, y, z): Navigate to aerial waypoint with obstacle avoidance
- hover_at(x, y, z, duration): Hover at position for specified time
- survey_area(x1, y1, x2, y2, altitude, method): Survey rectangular area (x1,y1 to x2,y2) at specified altitude using method 'rectangular' (perimeter) or 'zigzag' (area coverage)
- record_data(duration): Record aerial sensor data for specified duration
- inspect_target(x, y, z, radius): Orbital inspection around target
- land_at(x, y, z): Land at specified coordinates
- land_on_usv(): Land on USV deck for coordinated transport
- return_home(): Return to launch position and land

COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT: UAV takeoff only after USV reaches initial navigation goal
2. SPATIAL COORDINATION: Maintain safe separation during simultaneous operations
3. SYNCHRONIZED DATA COLLECTION: Coordinate sensor activation for comprehensive coverage
4. COMMUNICATION RELAY: UAV provides communication relay when USV is distant
5. SAFE RETURN SEQUENCE: UAV lands before USV final return to ensure safe operations

MISSION PARAMETERS:
- USV operates at surface level (z ≈ 0.5 to 2.0 meters)
- UAV operates at altitudes 10-25 meters for safety
- Inspection zones require both surface and aerial perspective
- Survey methods: Use 'rectangular' for perimeter surveys, 'zigzag' for full area coverage
- Weather conditions: Normal maritime operations
- Mission duration: Target completion within 15-20 minutes
